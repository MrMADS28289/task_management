## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrMADS28289/task_management.git
cd tasknest
```

### 2. Create a Python Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv task_env
# On Windows
.\task_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source task_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DEBUG=True
DB_PORT=5432
EMAIL_HOST=your_email_host
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

For production, ensure you set `DEBUG=False` and configure the following database environment variables:

```
DB_NAME=your_production_db_name
DB_USER=your_production_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_production_db_password
DB_HOST=your_production_db_host
DB_PORT=your_production_db_port
```

Also, update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `tasknest/settings.py` with your production domain(s) or IP address(es).

To generate a `SECRET_KEY`, run:

```bash
python manage.py get_random_secret_key
```

### 6. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

Ensure you have PostgreSQL running. Then, connect to your PostgreSQL server and create a database named `task_management`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tasknest;
```

### 7. Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 8. Build Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm run build:tailwind
```

### 9. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Linting and Type Checking

### Ruff (Linting)

```bash
ruff check . --fix
```

### Mypy (Type Checking)
